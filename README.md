### What is this project about?
In This project I implemented an algorithm to generate large amount of 3 dimensional pursuing (Men, Women and Dogs) in order to understand the power of beign a pursuer rather than being pursued.
This challenging idea was shared to me by a good friend - Dor Ben Yehuda, regarding his research on the subject.

### What is Stable Matching?
Stable Matching is designed to solve Pairing problems involving preferences of each participant, e.g. Marriage, 2-Person Teams, Delivery Networks
Having a given set of matches between A's and B's, a specific match will be called un-stable if:
* An A prefers to be with a different B than the one he is already matched with
&
* The same B prefers our given A more than the one he is matched with currently.

### 3 Dimensions???
The idea behind adding a third dimension comes from understanding that opening the matches to have Multi-Participant-Groups opens a large variety of applications for this model, e.g. Surgery Rooms, Supplier-Consumer-Investor.
